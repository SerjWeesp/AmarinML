# AmarinML

AmarinML is a Python package designed to provide a collection of useful machine learning functions to streamline and accelerate the process of model building, analysis, and evaluation. The package includes a variety of functions, tools, and utility scripts to assist data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

## Installation

To install the AmarinML package, you can clone it directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SerjWeesp/AmarinML.git
```

Make sure you have Git installed on your system, as this will allow `pip` to clone the repository and install the package.

result = 
print(result)
```

### Example
If you want to use a specific function from the `AmarinML.py` file:

```python
from amarinml.AmarinML import YourFunctionName

result = heatmap_spearman_significance(parameters)
print(result)
```

## Directory Structure
The project is organized in the following way:

```
